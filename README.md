# CycleGAN Tensorflow-Lite for Android

Android App for inference on a trained CycleGAN model using the TFLite format

## Part of an MSc project https://github.com/andrewginns/MSc-Project

The TFLite format is a new format opimised for mobile inference. This format allows for acceleration via the Android Neural Networks API available on all devices running Android 8.1 (API level 27) or higher.

This repository is based on the codelab for [Artistic Style Transfer in Android using TensorFlow](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-style-transfer-android/). It
is based on code forked from the [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) repository.
